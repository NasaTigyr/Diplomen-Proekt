    Option to either login/register or browse events as a guest.

2. Login/Registration Page:

    Login Form: Fields for username and password.
    Registration Form: Fields for name, email, password, and role selection (e.g., athlete, coach, referee).
    Include validation for form input (e.g., check if email format is correct, passwords match, etc.).

3. Event Page:

    List of all available events.
    Option to register for events (either individually or as part of a team, depending on the user type).

4. Dashboard (after login):

    Display the current user's information (name, role, etc.).
    If a coach or athlete, show the events they are registered for.
    If a coach, allow them to register athletes for events.

5. Event Management (for Coaches):

    Coaches should have a page where they can create events, categories, and register their athletes.
    Create Event Form: Fields for event name, date, category, and other event-specific details.
    Option to view a list of registered athletes for an event and generate a random draw.

Frontend Technologies:
