To ensure your site works on low-end devices and older computers, focus on performance optimization and lightweight design:
1. Use Minimalist Design

    Avoid heavy animations or excessive graphical elements.
    Use simple CSS for styling instead of relying on large libraries.

2. Responsive Design

    Use CSS media queries to adapt your site for different screen sizes.
    Use a mobile-first approach, designing for smaller screens and scaling up.

3. Optimize for Speed

    Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files to reduce load times.
    Optimize images (use formats like WebP) and load only whatâ€™s necessary for the viewport.
    Avoid large JavaScript frameworks if not necessary; stick to vanilla JavaScript or lightweight libraries.

4. Test on Low-End Devices

    Use browser tools to simulate slow network conditions (e.g., throttling).
    Test on older browsers using tools like BrowserStack.

5. Avoid Heavy Dependencies

    Use lightweight alternatives to common libraries (e.g., Pico.css instead of Bootstrap).
    Serve fonts locally to avoid external requests.

6. Static Content

    Serve your pages as static files whenever possible.
    Use server-side rendering (SSR) for dynamic content if needed.

Would you like a starting point with a lightweight layout or code examples for any of these steps?
